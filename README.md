## 🧭 Profile

Backend-focused Software Engineer with a strong systems mindset.
Experienced in building **production-grade services** with an emphasis on **reliability, observability, and automation**.

I work at the intersection of **backend engineering and AI**, integrating LLM-based capabilities into existing systems in a pragmatic, maintainable way.

## 🧠 Areas of Expertise

### AI Engineering

* LLM integration using OpenAI-compatible APIs and local models
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems
* Prompt design, evaluation, and failure handling
* Model-agnostic AI architectures for long-term maintainability

### Backend & Distributed Systems

* API design and backend services
* Microservices and event-driven architectures
* Service communication and fault tolerance
* Scalability-oriented system design

### DevOps & Platform

* CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
* Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
* Containerized deployments (Docker)
* Observability: metrics, logging, tracing (OpenTelemetry)

### Security-Oriented Development

* Secure API design
* Secrets management and least-privilege access
* System-level threat modeling

## 🔧 Tech Stack

**Languages**

* Python · TypeScript · Bash · SQL

**Backend**

## 🧪 What I Build

* Backend services designed for long-term operation
* APIs that prioritize correctness and stability
* Internal tools that remove operational friction
* AI features that deliver measurable value in real systems

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

* Clarity over cleverness
* Reliability over novelty
* Automation is part of the product
* If it can’t be observed, it can’t be trusted
* Production systems should be boring

## 🌍 Languages

* 🇪🇸 Spanish (native)
* 🇺🇸 English (professional)

### ☕ Note

Most professional work lives in private or internal repositories.
